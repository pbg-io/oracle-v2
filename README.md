# multi-sig-oracle-client

Multi Signature Oracle Client for PBG Token price feeds.

Though we (will soon) integrate with Orcfax price feeds, we must still maintain our own multi-sig infrastructure for price feed updates as we need a fallback in case there are problems with Orcfax.

A secondary reason is that our own multi-sig oracle infrastructure can be used in conjunction with Orcfax, to increase our Nakamoto coefficient by at least 1 (1 externally verifiable, 2 or more internally verifiable).

## Installing

Installation steps:

1. Go to `https://pbgtoken.github.io/oracle`
2. Optionally you can install this app as a PWA on your smart phone:
   - iOS: open site with Safari, and in the share menu, look for a button named 'Add to home screen'
   - Other platforms: use your browser's install or add-to-home-screen option
3. Configure your private key using 24 words
4. Configure your AWS account keys
5. Click 'Push validator'

## Deployment

GitHub Pages must be enabled in the repository settings for the Pages deployment workflow to publish the site correctly.
In GitHub, open `Settings -> Pages` for this repository, make sure GitHub Pages is activated, and set the source to `GitHub Actions`.
If Pages is left on branch-based publishing, GitHub can serve repository content such as `README.md` instead of the built app from `./dist`.

## AWS access keys

1. Create an AWS account
2. Login
3. Look for 'IAM'
4. Go to 'Users'
5. In the summary panel, below Access key 1, click 'Create access key'
6. Under use-cases, selected 'Third-party service'
7. Confirm that you understand the recommendation, and click 'Next'
8. As a description, write 'PBG Oracle'
9. Click 'show' under secret access key
10. Note the access key and secret access key in a safe place

## Network architecture

Active oracles are invited to help secure the PBGToken protocols.
When oracles accept the invitation they generate a new Ed25519 private-public keypair, and send the public key to PBGToken using external means.

PBG Token keeps a database of the public keys of all active oracles.

The oracle then has access to two endpoints:

1. GET `https://api.oracle.token.pbg.io/secrets`: fetch common secrets
2. POST `https://api.oracle.token.pbg.io/subscribe`: send the URL to the PBG Token backend

The common secrets are fetched right before a serverless function is pushed to the oracle's AWS account.
The subscribe endpoint is called right after the serverless function has been created and assigned a URL.

For the mainnet test environment, the following base URL is used: `https://api.oracle.beta.pbgtoken.io`
For preprod, the following base URL is used: `https://api.oracle.preprod.pbgtoken.io`

## History

The PBG oracle app has seen several iterations:

1. Progressive Web App (PWA) with a service-worker continuously runs, and using the WebPush API to get notified when transactions must be signed. Disadvantages:
    - Doesn't work on iOS because background-processes are severely throttled
    - Browser background processing is unreliable over long periods of inactivity
    - WebPush API has a typical latency of 10 seconds
2. Current: PWA that pushes JavaScript to a AWS serverless function (other cloud providers will be implemented later), and registers the URL of the serverless function with the PBGToken backend. The serverless function handles transaction validation and signing.
